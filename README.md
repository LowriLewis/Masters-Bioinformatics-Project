Single-cell transcriptomics data


Code written by myself to allow the study of a single-cell transcriptomics dataset, which was made publicly avalable online by the initial researchers (I have left their names and dataset out of this code). This code snippet is for the purpose to show what code I am able to write. It was initially written for a Research-based Masters degree. Obtained first-class mark for methodical R-scripting and findings.
